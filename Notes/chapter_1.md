### Chapter 1: Introduction
- There are two kinds of machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning which has pairs of inputs and desired outputs and unsupervised algorithms which only has input data.
- Data used to build the machine learning model is the training data/training set.
- Data used to assess how well a model works is the test data/test set/hold-out set.
- Inspect data to find abnormalities such as inconsistent measurements. These inconsistencies are very common in the real world. You can identify these peculiarities by using visualizer like a scatter plot.
